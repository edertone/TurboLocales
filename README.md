### General purpose text translations for sofware developers

TurboLocales is a text translation library that is designed to work as a general purpose resource of texts translations for sofware developers. All the translated texts are organized into different categories (bundles) that represent common application areas like "users", "products", "user-interface"...

By using TurboLocales you can avoid the tedious task of translating most of the commonly used texts that software applications use. 

### How to use it

You simply have to download the "TurboLocales-&lt;bundleformat&gt;" folder that is right for you and load it into your project like any other bundle you may use.

### Supported languages

The library currently supports the following languages:

- English (USA)
- Spanish (SPAIN)

Please help us grow this list!

### Localization bundle formats

This translation library is designed to be cross platform and it is structured in a per-bundle-format basis. This repository contains one folder for each one of the bundle formats in which the translations are avaliable. This is the list of bundle formats:

- TurboLocales-Properties

    - This folder contains the translated texts using the JAVA properties format. Each bundle is stored as a "&lt;bundlename&gt;/&lt;bundlename&gt;_&lt;xx_XX&gt;.properties" file where bundlename is the name of the bundle and xx_XX is the locale in which the texts are translated.   

Please help us improve this list. If you find for example that it would be interesting to have a "TurboLocales-Android-Json" folder containing all the translated texts in android json format, please contact us!

### Contribute

TurboLocales is 100% free and open source, but we will be really pleased to receive any help, support, comments or donations to help us improve this library. We are open to translation for new languages and new tags to be added to the library bundles. And if you like it, spread the word!
